* About
multi-line aims to provide a flexible framework for automatically
multi-lining and single-lining function invocations and definitions,
array and map literals and more. It relies on functions that are
defined on a per major mode basis wherever it can so that it functions
correctly across many different programming languages.
* Installation

Install from MELPA with ~M-x package-install multi-line~. See the [[https://github.com/milkypostman/melpa][melpa repository]] for details about how to set up MELPA if you have not already done so.
